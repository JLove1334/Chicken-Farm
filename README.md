# Chicken-Farm
Develop an app using Python to predict the following stats about their chickens and the eggs laid by them during a typical week. 
You have been contracted by a poultry farm to develop an app using Python (because the owner happens 
to have a pet Python) to predict the following stats about their chickens and the eggs laid by them during a 
typical week. They want to know, given a certain number of chickens, 
- what the distribution of eggs laid by them will be, 
- which chicken (each one has a unique serial number) lays the most number of eggs. If more than 
one of them lay this same number of eggs, then only the one with the lowest serial number needs 
to be identified. In that case, they also want to know how many other chickens will also lay that 
many eggs.
